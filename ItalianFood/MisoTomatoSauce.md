### About
Dish: Miso Tomato Sauce
Recipe Source: Myself! 
Servings: 6

### Preface
I prefer to eat this sauce with some fettucine, chiffonaded basil, and grated pecorino. But feel free to eat it with whatever pasta shape and toppings you want.

### Ingredients
- two 12 oz cans of crushed tomatoes 
- one tube of tomato paste (approximately 5.3 oz)
- two large yellow onions (small diced)
- 5 cloves of garlic (minced)
- 20 sprigs of thyme (leaves pulled off and roughly chopped)
- 4-5 canned anchovies (or an entire tin if you just want to use the entire thing up)
- 1/4 cup olive oil 
- 1/2 cup of red wine
- 1 lb of ground beef (or protein of your choice)
- 2 tbsp miso paste
    - alternatively: soy sauce to taste
- black pepper to taste
- white sugar to taste
- rind of pecorino romano

### Steps
1) Heat your 6 quart pot over medium high heat
    - if you're using a enamel cast iron pan pour in the olive oil first before heating, to prevent the enamel from chipping
2) When your pot is hot enough where splashing water results in the water droplets bouncing around before evaporating (or when the oil starts shimmering), pour in the olive oil and let it coat the bottom of the pan
3) Toss in onions and garlic and saute them until the onions are transulcent and lightly browning. Stir often to prevent the garlic from burning or sticking.
4) Once onions are done, squeeze half of the tube tomato paste into the pot, and stir it around until all the onions are coated. 
    - If you want, just use the entire tube of tomato paste
5) Let the tomato paste sit until it starts to carmelize on the bottom of the pan.
6) Once the tomato paste is a deep brown add a spash of water and use your stirring utensil to scrape it off the bottom of the pan. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until the tomato paste goes from a bright red to a mahogany color.
7) When you're satisfied with the color of the tomato paste, add the anchovies and stir them until they dissolve into the pot. At the same time, in a separate pan, brown your ground beef over medium high heat and break it apart into smaller pieces. 
8) When you no longer see pieces of anchovies in the pot, add your: canned tomatoes, red wine, thyme, pecorino rind, soy sauce or miso paste, sugar, and black pepper. Reduce the heat to medium.
9) When the meat is sufficiently browned, add it to your pot and stir. Let the sauce cook partially covered for 30 minutes.


### Notes
- [5/16/2020] 
    - Made the recipe with miso paste and it was delicious. The most prominent flavor was still the tomato and beef flavor, but the miso added a delicate kelp-y / bonito-y after taste.
