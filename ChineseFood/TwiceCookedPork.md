### Notes

    - Subs:
        - baby leeks / Chinese leaf garlic => garlic chives (OK)
        - caster sugar => regular sugar (OK)
        - fresh red chili / pepper => thai chilis for extra kick (OK)
    - When I made this the first time I didn't use proper measuring spoons, I just used the spoons in my drawer
    - The dish was a bit too salty, and I don't think I even added the extra dark soy sauce
    - The flavor of the Doubanjiang + Douchi + fermented sweet sauce is VERY similar to the taste of Ssamjang. I think in a pinch you could substitute the mixture with Ssamjang and get an incredibly similar flavor but this remains to be tested.
