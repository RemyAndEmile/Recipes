### Notes
- \[4/16/2020]
    - Subs:
        - caster sugar => regular sugar (OK)
        - stock => chicken stock (OK)
        - potato starch => corn starch (OK)
    - For making it the first time it was pretty good. I wasn't able to make the eggplant as crunchy as I would like, but I'm thinking that I might need to lightly dredge the eggplants before frying.
    - I also didn't let the eggplant sit long enough. They probably only drained for 20 mins.
    - TODO
        - let eggplant drain for longer
        - try dredging eggplant before frying
        - try using basalmic vinegar as a substitute to see if we can still get a similar flavor
        - try adding sichuan peppercorn?
