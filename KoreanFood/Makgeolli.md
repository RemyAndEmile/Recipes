### About
Dish: Makgeolli (Korean Rustic Rice Wine)
Recipe Source: https://kimchimari.com/how-to-make-makgeolli/
Servings: ~2 quarts

### Ingredients
- 1 kg sweet rice
- 95 g nuruk starter
- 1 L spring water

### Steps
1) Rinse sweet rice several times until water runs clear; on average I need to replace the water around 6 times to achieve this.
2) Let rice soak for 2 hours, up to overnight.
3) Strain rice for 30 minutes until most of the excess water is removed
4) Steam rice for 40 minutes.
5) Spread rice out on a clean baking sheet or other clean surface, and let it cool until it's no longer warm to the touch. In the meantime mix your nuruk with spring water in a separate bowl and let it soak. Break any large chunks of nuruk up.
6) In a clean fermenting container, mix rice with nuruk-water mixture and stir until ingredients are well incorporated. Cover the container with a breathable fabric and let it rest in a warm area of the house (should be around 75F).
7) On days 1-3 of the ferment, stir the makgeolli with a sanitized utensil twice a day.
8) On days 4-14, replace the breathable fabric with a lid and let it rest until the ferment is done. Occasionally check on it to ensure that no mold has formed.
9) Once the ferment is done, strain the makgeolli with a cheese cloth and store the final product in the fridge.

### Notes
- Personally when I sanitize my fermentation crock and utensils I just pour boiling water over them. I haven't been using a no rinse sanitization solution.
- After the first day of fermentation, the rice will be quite dry and difficult to stir. As the ferement progresses, you should see more moisture.
- Starting around day 2, I tend to smell sweet, fruity (like korean pear), and floral notes from the makgeolli. When I stir it, I also hear bubbling in the liquid, which is usually a good indication that the ferment is progressing.
- Once before, the final product was funky and almost cheesy. A piece of hair fell into it, so I suspect that it may have affected the ferment.
